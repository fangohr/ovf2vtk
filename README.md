# ovf2vtk

Update May 2020:

Outdated. The conversion capability is available as part of the [discretisedfield package](https://discretisedfield.readthedocs.io).

See in particular:

https://discretisedfield.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ipynb/12-tutorial-ovf2vtk.html

--------------------------------------------------------------

Original note ~ 2015:


Conversion tool, translating OOMMF's omf/ovf files to vtk files (Visualisation Tool Kit)

Starting from an ancient release, we will try to develop a newer version here.

All code experimental for now, please use sources from http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~fangohr/software/ovf2vtk
until this notice is changed.
