ovf2vtk -- data conversion from OOMMF's ovf/ovf file format to VTK.


This program reads ovf files keeping vector data from the OOMMF
simulation package, extracts the data, optionally adds derived
observables (mainly curl and divergence) and saves the input data and
any derived entities into VTK files.

Supported file formats are:

input files:

   ovf files(v1.0), rectangular mesh only
   data can be ascii, binary4 or binary 8

output files:

   VTK File Formats Standard 2.0. (This depends on PyVTK.)
